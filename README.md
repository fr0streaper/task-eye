# TaskEye

## Description

A bot for getting notifications from various task-tracking systems. Currently implemented for the Telegram messenger and the Trello task-tracking system, but can be extended to other platforms. Written as a project for the summer practice at ITMO University. Can be found at @taskeye, though it's probably not runnning now since I hosted it locally through ngrok while developing. You can take a look at how the usage goes here (the captions are in Russian, but the actual bot interface is all in English): [imgur link](https://imgur.com/a/HeF4ilC).

## Note on running

I purposely left the fields of BotData.java empty, as that class was specifically put in there to store private information (such as the bot token and the Trello API key). If for some reason you want to host this bot yourself, please contact me @fr0streaper basically anywhere, or create your own bot and API key and use them.
